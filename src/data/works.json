      "Working in an Agile team delivering a wide range of projects. As part of the Frontend team, I focused on developing React web applications, with high emphasis on performance and user experience. In order to achieve this, I have implemented a variety of technologies, tools and services that have fulfilled those expectations and in many ways have lowered the cost and improved substantially the development experience, thus increasing the work delivery. In addition, I have worked closely with Backend and Cloud team not only to expand my knowledge in those areas, but also to apply solutions that improve my projects overall. Last but not least, I have been an integral part of interview processes to expand my current team and the mentoring process for our graduates.",
